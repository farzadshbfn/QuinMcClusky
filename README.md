# QuinMcClusky
C++ implementation of Quin-McClusky algorithm for minimizing minterms.

<h4>pair&ltint,int&gt used in code (as ii) is a PrimeImplicant and is stored as following:</h4>

.first holds: one representations

.second holds: x representations



<h5>for example: 00x11x01x will be:</h5>

.first = 000110010

.second = 001001001
